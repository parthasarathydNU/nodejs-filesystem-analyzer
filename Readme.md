# File System Analyzer

### Overview
The File System Analyzer is a command-line tool built with Node.js that provides detailed analysis of a directory structure. It leverages core Node.js modules to scan directories, analyze files, and generate comprehensive reports.

### Objectives
1. Demonstrate proficiency with Node.js core modules
2. Implement efficient file system operations
3. Showcase asynchronous programming patterns
4. Apply event-driven programming concepts
5. Create a practical, extensible CLI tool

Certainly! Here's a setup section you can add to your README.md file. This section provides clear instructions for setting up the File System Analyzer project:

### Setup

Follow these steps to set up the File System Analyzer project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/nodejs-filesystem-analyzer.git
   cd file-system-analyzer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 14.x or later), then run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   To ensure everything is set up correctly, run the test suite:
   ```
   npm test
   ```

4. **Run the analyzer**
   To analyze a directory, use the following command:
   ```
   npm run analyze /path/to/directory
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path you want to analyze.



### Key Features
1. Recursive directory scanning
2. File analysis (size, type, creation date)
3. File hashing for integrity checks
4. Generation of detailed analysis reports
5. System information inclusion in reports
6. Progress tracking using custom event emitters
7. Efficient large file handling using streams

### Technical Stack
- Node.js (Latest LTS version)
- Core Modules:
  - fs (File System operations)
  - path (Path manipulation)
  - crypto (File hashing)
  - stream (Efficient file reading)
  - events (Custom event emitters)
  - os (System information)
  - util (Utility functions)
